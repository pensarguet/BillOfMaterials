# BillOfMaterials
Bill of Materials (BOM) for my home office

# Why a bill of materials
Because Covid-19 pandemic change deeply the way to work, home or remote office became the defacto model once you're in tech! When a part of your home become your office, it's the place where you spend most of your days... and part of nights, sometimes.

Outside of mental sanitary good practices that are mandatory in my humble opinion to sustain in the long term, I think it's important to have a place where you are pleased to go with material that makes you performing and successful in your job. Beware, I do not think it's a all in one approach, and in my case I build my setup pieces after pieces, enriching my experience based on what I was missing. 

Another reason to share my bill of materials is that as more and more friends or colleagues are turning remote working, lot of them asked me what pieces I picked!

# The desk
After spending days on a (too) small table, I definitively switch to an **height adjustable desk**. After a quick lookup to the market and feedback, I choose a standing desk frame 3-Stage Dual-Motor E5 from Flexispot (https://flexispot.co.uk). With three programmable presets, you can easily save your favorite seated, standing, and underdesk cycling heights. You can also setup convenient activity alerts to remind you to sit or stand at regular intervals, or turn the alerts off completely when necessary. After some days of practice, I mainly use a stand up position at 110 cm and a sit down position at 75 cm.

For the desktop, as I wanted something in **bamboo**, I choose Hilver at Ikea with 140x65 cm size.


# The keyboard and wrist rest
My keyboard is a mechanical one as I love the touch of those ones. I picked an  **APEX 7** (https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-7?switch=red) from **Steelserie** (https://steelseries.com) with linear and quiet red switches. It's certainly a geeky feature but I like the OLED display which act as an integrated command center for useful information. There are also up to 6 macro buttons for quick shortcuts. The keyboard frame is in aluminum alloy, heavy and stable; nothing moves on the desktop!

I also decided to choose this APEX7 because it is deliver with a **magnetic wrist rest**. It is link to the keyboard with a simple magnetic solution for easy and secure attachment. It is big enough for a full palm support, and have a soft touch finish, so youâ€™re comfortable typing or coding as long as you want!

# The microphone
After spending hours in calls or video meetings, I quickly decided to pick for an external mic with good quality for live discussions or recorded sessions. 

After a quick market analysis and comments review, I decided to choose a **Rode NT-USB** (http://en.rode.com/microphones/nt-usb) I bought from Woodbrass (https://www.woodbrass.com). Along its good quality, the microphone comes with a microphone clamp, a tripod and a custom pop filter. On the side, you will find two rotary knobs and a connection for a headphone. The lower button allows you to adjust the volume of the headphones and using the upper button you can adjust the sound of your computer to that of the microphone. 

The microphone plugs in over USB which means it does not need a microphone port and appears as a recording input for easy selection in Zoom, Webex, Google Meet or Microsoft Teams. For podcast and audio session, I use the free, cross platform and open source **Audacity** (https://www.audacityteam.org).

Because It was important for me to keep my desktop not too crowded, I quickly consider to add a boom arm which became quickly essential for moving the microphone off the desktop, as well as to have it close to where I needed. I choose the **Rode PSA1** (http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1) which fits perfectly with my NT-USB mic.

# DAC / Audio Interface
It's certainly an over-hyped part of the setup, but I wanted a DAC to bypass the poor one of my laptop for better sound and music quality. I decided to choose a **Schiit Modi 3** (https://www.schiit.com/products/modi-1) as DAC and audio output for my speakers. It is powered over USB and appears as a regular output device from the OS. 

I'm big fan of Schiit products (https://www.schiit.com). As I'm based in europe, I use the Schiit Europ online shopping site (https://www.schiit-europe.com/). It's currently complicated to order as there is few products availabilities and hundreds of people who want them!
